# Typo in Tailwind CSS Class Name

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug that can occur when using Tailwind CSS: typos in class names.  The error is not always easily detected as Tailwind may not raise an explicit error. Instead, the element might not be styled or may have unexpected styling. This example shows how a small typo can break styling and how to easily identify the issue using your browser's developer tools.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies (if needed).
3. Open `bug.html` in your browser. Note the unexpected styling.
4. Review the `bug.js` file to see the specific typo.
5. Compare with `bugSolution.js` which fixes the typo.
